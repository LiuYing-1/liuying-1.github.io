On the one hand, we would like to keep the clean interfaces so we need to have as simple components (abstractions). On the other hand, we still need to get the most use of performance which means we need to break the abstractions. Hence, we need to find ways where abstractions are sensible barriers that do not end up performance. Then, the final part is fault-tolerance.</p> <p>When introducing an abstraction, we will have a barrier between two components, and in particular, you will need to have a communication mechanism on this barrier. Hence, when introducing components, we increase the attack. (<font color="red">Not fully understood</font>)</p> <h4 id="fundamental-abstractions">Fundamental abstractions</h4> <p><strong>Memory abstraction</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(Read/Write)</code></p> <p>A memory abstraction is something that allows you to read values and write values.</p> <p><strong>Interpreters abstraction</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(loop(print(eval(read))))</code></p> <p>Have a set of commands that you can execute and the interpreter’s input instructions from somewhere else. They evaluate the instructions and print some output and continue this in a loop.</p> <p><strong>Communication links abstraction</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send/Receive</code></p> <p>It can be async and we don’t wait for the response or something like that.</p> <p><strong>Names</strong> make connections (glue) between these abstractions. Where do we read from or where do we write to? It can be any kind of format, e.g., addresses, IP addresses, web addresses, filenames, emails, telephone numbers, and so on.</p> <p>Sometimes, we call a name an address if it has some location information. <strong>Address is an overloaded name with location info. (e.g., LOAD 1742, R1)</strong>. The rest of the names require a mapping scheme to translate the original info into a fixed location. For example, a website is commonly associated with an IP address, and so on.</p> <h4 id="name-mapping">Name Mapping</h4> <p><strong>How can we map names?</strong></p> <p>We usually have some algorithms that take as input the names and some contexts and produce the addresses.</p> <p><strong><em>Type 1: Table lookup</em></strong> <em>Files inside directories.</em></p> <p>Typically, there will be something like a table lookup first so you could look up a file inside of a directory by taking the file name depending on the file system you are using, the precise lookup may look differently, but in practice, it translates to a table lookup or you can contact the DNS service to resolve the web address to an IP address. All these are called table lookups.</p> <p><strong><em>Type 2: Recursive lookup</em></strong> <em>Path names in file systems or URLs</em></p> <p>There might be some names structured with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, just like URLs, web addresses, or file paths. We need the recursive lookup or combine it with the table lookup to get to the location we are interested in.</p> <p><strong><em>Type 3: Multiple lookup</em></strong> <em>Java class loading</em></p> <p>When we code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Overloading</code> with Java, we might call a method in Java. This can be long multiple classes and you try to find or Java tries to find the best matching instance of the class to pick the implementation of the method you’re interested in. It is based on the types of objects involved.</p> <h4 id="memory-abstraction">Memory Abstraction</h4> <p><strong>API of the memory</strong></p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ(name) -&gt; value</code>: read from a name and obtain a value</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WRITE(name, value)</code>: where to write and which value to write</p> <p><strong>Examples of Memory</strong></p> <p><em>Physical memory is limited to the size of the RAM chip, virtual memory is limited by the size of the hard disk.</em></p> <p><em>RAM stores virtual addresses, while the disk stores physical addresses.</em></p> <p>Typically, when we are writing to the physical memory and our computer, we are using a physical address but typically we don’t address the RAM directly. But we work with a multi-level memory hierarchy that goes from memory that we can access quickly like the RAM.</p> <h4 id="how-would-you-design-a-two-level-memory-abstraction-consolidating-disk-and-ram">How would you design a two-level memory abstraction consolidating disk and RAM?</h4> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SCFqonm.jpeg" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <p><br> RAM is extremely expensive and it is volatile, but its speed is fast. While the Disk is in contrast that the price is very low and it is nonvolatile, however, it is high latency. Design top-level abstraction respecting <em>Memory API</em>.</p> <p><strong>Requirements below</strong></p> <ol> <li>Address as much data as fits in disk</li> <li>Use fixed-size pages for disk transfers</li> <li>Use RAM efficiently to provide for low latency (on average)</li> <li>Neither disk nor memory directly exposed, only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ/WRITE</code> API.</li> </ol> <p><em>What does it mean to implement an abstraction? - What we need to do is implement the read and write functions and hide the two-level hierarcy to the users</em>.</p> <p><strong>Proposal</strong> by the student</p> <p>Store both data in the RAM and disk. And always access the RAM first, if RAM finds the value, that’s good. When does not, then RAM would swap in the data from disk and to swap in RAM would use. Maybe at least recently use strategy to decide which page from the disk answer from the RAM to swap out.</p> <p>This is principal right, but an advanced version with smart data structures is below.</p> <p><strong>Hint</strong></p> <p>We have two address spaces, we have the addresses on the disk and addresses on the RAM. We need to bridge the gap between the two. So we introduce the naming scheme that operates with addresses of disk + RAM. So those are the virtual addresses and they give us as many addresses as we can access with the extraction. And we need to have something that translates these virtual addresses into concrete physical addresses. This could be a disk address or memory address. So the page map for example will have the virtual address, the page identifier and that will translate to the block number. Maybe on the disk first time I saw the block number memory. Let’s start with that.</p> <p>RAM stores most recently used pages and page map. <strong><em>Resident bit (R):</em></strong> access to non-resident pages results in page faults. <strong><em>Page fault</em></strong>:an indirection exception for missing pages.</p> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/O535uxz.jpeg" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <p>Trap to OS handler and handler loads block from disk and updates mapping.

Page replacement algorithm, e.g., LRU.</p> <p>Other metadata: <strong><em>Dirty bit (D):</em></strong> Only write page back when it has changed! Pin bit (p): do not remove certain pages (e.g., code of OS handler itself)</p> <p><strong>Answer</strong></p> <p>To achieve this objective, we should put a page map recording <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#Page</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#Block</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pr</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> into the RAM, with some pages selected automatically which are mostly used recently by the computer. Then, when accessing a data. The computer system will access the RAM to lookup the table. Check whether the page is resident or not by verifing its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resident bit</code>. If value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>, then just get the data from the table which is already stored in the RAM. If not, check whether the RAM is full or not. If it is already full, apply LRU strategy to find out the record which is ready to replace. Then, check its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dirty bit</code> whether it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>. If the value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>, write the page back to the disk, then, clear that page in the RAM and replace it with the needed new page. Otherwise, clear and replace the needed new page.s</p> <h4 id="virtual-memory-with-paging">Virtual Memory with Paging</h4> <p>Abstraction: Do we have any guarantees on two concurrent threads writing to the same memory?</p> <ul> <li>No, we don’t have any guarantees regarding concurrent access.</li> </ul> <p>Performance: Do we get average latency close to RAM latency?</p> <ul> <li>Yes.
