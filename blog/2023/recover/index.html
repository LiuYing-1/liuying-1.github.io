What about page replacement? <ul> <li>We have pages sitting on the RAM and pages sitting on the disk and modify and read most of the time hopefully from the RAM and then we need to do these transferred pages and talked about different strategies like LRU to exchange pages. =&gt; <a href="https://liuying-1.github.io/advanced-computer-system/abstractions/">Virtual Memory with Paging</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li>What were the guarantees we got in terms of atomicity and fault-tolerance? <ul> <li>The atomicity here is referred to the strong modularity. <ul> <li>We did provide an abstraction that is only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WRITE</code>s. So the user does not need to think about the existence of the RAM or the disk. Users simply get flat address space. Let’s say that can address as much memory as there is on disk and that’s it from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WRITE</code>s towards the abstraction. So this gives us a certain kind of atomicity in the sense that we can consider this entire system as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WRITE</code>s.</li> <li>But of course, internally there are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WRITE</code>s small operations and probably in the design that we did they’ve not isolated, and this certainly not atomic and not durable in the sense of <strong>before-after atomicity</strong> and the sense of <strong>All-or-Nothing atomicity</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What about fault-tolerance? <ul> <li>I am not fault-tolerant for respective disk errors. So no guarantees in terms of tolerance and partially the answer to our guarantees of ours will be given in today’s next lecture when we talk about recovery. How can we recover from these problems?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="analytical-modeling">Analytical Modeling</h3> <p>So, according to the previous example, we can introduce a new kind of question. Given such a system, and discuss its performance. The previous example is about latency.</p> <ul> <li>Get intuition about system performance <ul> <li>Without actually implementing it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Remember our virtual memory system with paging? Simple model: <ul> <li>$AverageLatency = HitRation * Latency_{Hit} + (1- HitRatio) * Latency_{Miss}$</li> <li>The explanation above is about the probability that the needed data is on the RAM times the latency that accesses the RAM, plus the probability that the needed data is on the disk times the latency communicating to the disk (additionally, the page transfer from there)</li> <li>However, in reality, the model cannot be such kind of easy. It still can have some other factors, there is some overhead coming from translating the flat address space to concrete and this can be considered as constant time (+c) in the model.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>However, let’s start with the simple model without any refinement.</p> </li> <li>So we can say now if the hit ratio is pretty high, the average time will be close to the latency of the main memory. =&gt; With a high hit ratio (say, &gt;95%), average time can be pretty close to the main memory <ul> <li>Some requests still require going to disk, of course, and take full disk latency blow</li> </ul> </li> <li>The question is how can we know the hit ratio? And that’s the relatively tricky part always was analytical modeling. You just get formulas and how you think your systems behave but getting things precise? So one way to get things a bit more precise is to perform simulations.</li> </ul> <h3 id="simulation">Simulation</h3> <p>We want to obtain the HitRatio by <strong>measuring</strong> it. So we will simulate a particular component of the system, maybe the virtual memory with paging component and you will estimate certain known parameters like latency of the main memory and the latency of the disk. Those are easier to get out from other specifications than the HitRatio which is certainly workloads specific. Then, we try different workloads to measure the HitRatio on our partial implementation that focuses on this particular aspect of the system. That’s a simulation.</p> <ul> <li>Study properties of hard-to-model process, e.g., locality of workloads vs. Hit ratio in cache</li> <li>Configure model with known parameters <ul> <li>In our example, $Latency_{Hit}$ and $Latency_{Miss}$</li> </ul> </li> <li>Simulate behavior of system to get HitRatio</li> </ul> <h3 id="pros--cons-of-simulation">Pros &amp; Cons of Simulation</h3> <p>Why do we consider such things? It’s a way to estimate difficult parameters, and it may be easier to do this rather than performing a full-blown implementation of the entire system and measuring the actual HitRatio. =&gt; If you want to implement the whole system and measure the actual value, that is the so-called Experiment.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Pros</p> <ul> <li>Effort may be smaller than full-blown implementation</li> <li>Allows you to simulate “impossible” or hard-to-experiment-with scenarios -&gt; 10Ks of machines, next generation flash disk not on the market yet.</li> </ul> <p>So, these are some advantages of simulations against experimental.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cons</p> <ul> <li>Estimating paramters =&gt; We need to estimate certain parameters and <strong>we do not know whether the system will put them in the first place.</strong> </li> <li>Validating models and approximations</li> <li>Choosing workloads =&gt; How can we choose a workload that is representative of the thing that we want to measure. Different workloads will have different HitRatios. =&gt; <strong>What is a representative workload?</strong> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="numbers-everyone-should-know">Numbers Everyone Should Know</h3> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ry3pzb8.png" alt="image-20230105162342099" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"> </div> </div> </div> <p>And remember, do not switch them even though they do stay roughly the same.

How can we choose workloads?</p> <ul> <li>Synthetic workloads &amp; datasets =&gt; Always tricky and probably you don’t want to generate data or actions or transactions that’s what workload is made of uniformly and randomly.

But on the other side, <strong><em>we can survive with respect to crashes due to the durability because everything is written on the disk.</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>Poor response time</li> <li>But provides durability</li> </ul> <p>However, because we don’t want to wait for every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WRITE</code> been propagated to the disk (i.e., As 2 level memory abstraction, we want the performance =&gt; latency to be close to the RAM, so we should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No Force</code>), we want to lean to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No Force</code> side.</p> <h4 id="steal">Steal</h4> <p>And now, given that, there will be a quite lot of contention on the memory because everybody will want to write to the fast medium and things then will live in memory.</p> <p>The different <strong><em>transactions compete for space in the Buffer-Pool</em></strong>. And the question is if there is too little space, what should happen? A transaction that wants to write something, can it steal a frame or page from another transaction that may be not even committed yet?</p> <p>So <strong><em>if we don’t steal pages, this means our memories are the critical region. Then the transactions will block if they want to access a page but they cannot get a page from the memory</em></strong>. This will impact our throughput and this means that <strong><em>we want to lean on the stealing side where our transaction is allowed to steal a page that belongs to a potential uncommitted transaction</em></strong>.</p> <p>If in the corner of “No Steal” and “Force”, it can ensure atomicity and durability. However, if in the “Desired” corner, both questions become open.</p> <ul> <li>If not, poor throughput.</li> <li>If so, how can we ensure atomicity?</li> </ul> <h4 id="fill-in-the-matrix">Fill in the matrix</h4> <p><strong><em>When do you need to UNDO changes?</em></strong> =&gt; STEAL</p> <p>So for this problem, we need to consider what happens to the disk.</p> <p><strong>If we steal</strong>, for example, frames or pages, <strong>we might end up with pages of uncommitted transactions written to the disk</strong>. And there is a certain danger always that the transaction gets aborted. For example, <strong>if a crash occurs, so we might need UNDO</strong>. <strong><em><u>So, on the Steal side of things, we need UNDO.</u></em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>When do you need to REDO changes?</em></strong></p> <p>When we don’t write things into the disk, you might have committed transactions that don’t write immediately to the disk. =&gt; <strong><em>We might have committed transactions whose modifications only live in memory.</em></strong> And if at that point, a crash occurs, we need to first see how we can redo the actions but <strong><em>we need to REDO them because the things that changed in this memory will be lost</em></strong>. <strong><em>So whenever we don’t force things, we need REDO things.</em></strong></p> <h3 id="more-on-steal-and-force">More on Steal and Force</h3> <p><strong><u>STEAL</u></strong> is essentially the justification why enforcing <strong><em><u>atomicity</u></em></strong> is hard.</p> <p>Suppose the frame or the page that we are about to steal is already written to the disk and particular some transaction holds the lock on this page. Now we need to consider what happens if this transaction aborts.</p> <p>We need to remember the old value that was stored on this page at the moment of the steal to UNDO the write that we just performed to this disk.</p> <ul> <li>To steal frame F: Current page in F (say P) is written to disk; some transaction holds lock on P. <ul> <li>What if the transaction with the lock on P aborts?</li> <li>Must remember the old value of P at steal time (to support UNDOing the write to page P).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I think this is just the same case as what we have mentioned when talking about filling in the matrix. <strong><em>And this is all to enforce that we cannot have partially executed transactions and then see the effects on the memory.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><u>NO FORCE</u></strong> (Why enforcing <strong><em><u>Durability</u></em></strong> is hard) =&gt; We are not necessarily writing modifications by committed transactions immediately to disk.</p> <ul> <li>What if system crashes before a modified page is written to disk?</li> <li>Write as little as possible, in a convenient place, at commit time, to support REDOing modifications.</li> </ul> <h3 id="undoredo-vs-forcesteal">UNDO/REDO vs. FORCE/STEAL</h3> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VOyswRe.png" alt="image-20230106000931305" style="zoom:50%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong><em><u>In the case of NO FORCE, we need to REDO things. In the case of STEAL, we need to UNDO things.</u></em></strong> And how do we support the hardest corner that we desired?</p> <h3 id="basic-idea-logging">Basic Idea: Logging</h3> <p>To approach this corner, we can use <strong><em><u>logging</u></em></strong> and <strong><em><u>log all the operations</u></em></strong> that we do on the database. So there will be <strong><em><u>record information that this relevant for both REDOing and UNDOing actions for every update</u></em></strong>.</p> <p>We store these in the so-called log. <em><u>We write sequentially to the logs, that's the order of things determined there. We have S2PL so the actions are ordered somehow.</u></em></p> <p>We also <em><u>put it maybe on a separate disk</u></em>, hopefully on stable storage when we don’t want to lose the log.</p> <p>We try to <em><u>write some minimal information</u></em> that is required to perform our changes. We do not want to duplicate the database in the log. But in particular, we compress things so that multiple updates fit in a single log page. So whenever we write to the log, we are performing effectively <em><u>many more writes than when we actually write data to disk</u></em>.</p> <hr> <p>Record REDO and UNDO information, for every update, in a <strong><em>log</em></strong>.</p> <ul> <li>Sequential writes to log (put it on a separate disk).</li> <li>Minimal info (diff) written to log, so multiple updates fit in a single log page.</li> </ul> <hr> <p>Thus, what is a <strong>log</strong>?</p> <p><strong>Log</strong> can be thought of abstraction of the sequence of REDO and UNDO actions. There are different ways of logging standard approaches, they are <strong><em><u>Logical</u></em></strong> and <strong><em><u>Physical Logging</u></em></strong>. Example physical log record contains:</p> \[&lt;XID, pageID, offset, length, old \ data, new \ data&gt;\] <p>And there are also compromises where for certain parts, you do physical data use or both the old and the new value. For other parts of other types of database, we store some logical orientation of difference that you can then both REDO and UNDO. =&gt; <em><u>Good compromise is physiological logging.</u></em></p> <p>But for simplicity, we only consider physical logging. =&gt; And <strong>UNDO</strong> is just write the <strong>old data</strong>, <strong>REDO</strong> is just write <strong>new data</strong>.</p> <h3 id="write-ahead-logging-wal">Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)</h3> <p>The fundamental principle that makes it work is called Write-Ahead Logging.</p> <p>Golden Rule: The idea is that <strong><em><u>you never modify the only copy of your data</u></em></strong>. <strong><em>Kind of always have a log and you modify the log before you actually modify the data.</em></strong></p> <p>WAL consists of two principles,</p> <ul> <li>Must <strong>force</strong> the <strong>log record</strong> for an update <u>**_before_**</u> the corresponding <strong>data page</strong> gets to disk. =&gt; Guarantees <strong>Atomicity</strong> =&gt; Transaction =&gt; If one transaction get fully executed, then get a log record.</li> <li>Must <strong>write all log records</strong> for a transaction <strong><em><u>before commit</u></em></strong>. =&gt; Guarantees <strong>Durability</strong> =&gt; Commit (<strong>Evidence</strong> for Recovery)</li> </ul> <p>Exactly how is logging (and recovery!) done?
