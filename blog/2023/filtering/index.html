But the center could be anywhere in the window.</p> <p>For instance, if we use NW pixel here, we could consider not the actual neighbors around the target, but the pixels that are to the right and below the target because then, the target would be right here.</p> <h4 id="filtering-with-a-sliding-neighborhood-window">Filtering with a sliding neighborhood window</h4> <p>How we apply the filter to an image is that, we position our neighborhood window somewhere. We assume that our target pixel is where I put the red dot. And that <strong>the center of the mask is also in the middle of the window</strong>. =&gt; So these two things overlap and it means that we are considering all the pixels in this window that we do some function of these pixel values to compute a value for the pixel in the middle.</p> <p>So we are creating a new image where in the new image, the pixel at that location would be a function of all the pixels here in the input. And it’s normal to have this sliding window apprach where you move this window across the image.</p> <p>It’s natural to take stride of 1 pixel so that you move the window by shifting one pixel.</p> <p>But in principle, we could take larger strides. In this case, we’are ending up with the resulting image that comes out of the filter has a lower resolution than the input.</p> <p>If the stride is 2, then, we are halving the width and the height of the image.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CLpWR2Y.png" alt="image-20230214195900647" style="zoom:67%;"></div> <h4 id="linear-discrete-filtering">Linear discrete filtering</h4> <p>Consider a discrete image defined by the function $f(x, y):\Omega \mapsto \R$ where $\Omega \subseteq \Z^2$. For simplicity we consider a real-valued 1 channel image. $\Z$ represents the integers.</p> <p>A linear filter is defined by an <strong>impulse response</strong> given by the function $h(x, y): H\mapsto \R$ where $H \subseteq \Z^2$.</p> <p>If $h$ has finite support (finite impluse response (RIR)) with neighborhood window size $N\times M$, then applying the linear filter to our image $f$ is done by discrete convolution</p> \[g(x, y) = \{ f*h\}(x, y) = \sum^{\lfloor N/2\rfloor}_{i=-\lfloor N/2\rfloor}\sum^{\lfloor M/2\rfloor}_{j=-\lfloor M/2\rfloor}f(x-i, y-i)h(i, j)\] <p>Notice the convention of flipping $f$ instead of $h$. =&gt; It’s equivalent to either do the shifting in each. They lead to the same result. So when programming, we need to consider whether it’s easier to flip the image or the filter kernel.</p> <h4 id="discrete-filtering-for-one-pixel-in-output-image">Discrete filtering for one pixel in output image</h4> <div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7yxuDUZ.png" alt="image-20230214203115471" style="zoom:67%;"></div> <p>We could think of it as we take the block of pixels around the target and then we flip it left to right and upside down as well. Then, we start to do the product.</p> <p>So, image in, we need to define an impulse function $h$ - FIR and represent it with some filter mask / kernel and by applying convolution, we get a new image out =&gt; $g$.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yMaEPaV.png" alt="image-20230214203919061" style="zoom:50%;"></div> <p>So as before what happens when you do convolution, you consider all the pixels in the image.

In this way, I can use the this to perform template matching.</p> <p>Let’s assume that we cut out a face from this image. And that face forms my filter kernel. I do a little bit of normalization of the intensities to do cross-correlation in a proper way. I take this filter and then I do discrete correlation.</p> <p>I would expect that as we move this filter across the image, then, at each location where the pixels in the filter and in the image are similar you get a high value out of this correlation. We get the left image and you can see that there’s some extra bright spots and if we take these local maxims, these local bright spots and make a cut out of the same size as the filter. Let’s say we have a bright spot and I think that is one guy’s face and we then cut out the filter and then plot that as pieces of images that we stick together.</p> <p><strong>For template matching, if you have a simple template that you want to search for copies.

It looks like it cna clean up the salt and pepper noise. It looks like almost the original or at least very similar to what we have in (a). The reason why we get this is that since we’re applying a median filter, even though it’s only $3\times 3$ pixels. If we consider a pixel that they contains either salt or pepper, the neighborhood of that which contains a lot of pixels that have the almost same value. =&gt; The median of the distribution of those nine pixels in that neighborhood would lead to a gray background pixel.

That is construct derivative filters.</p> <p>We had this two views of an image either as an array of pixel values, or we could do this function interpretation. And in the function interpretation, we think of the image as being a function of two variables $x$ and $y$.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jirdwlq.png" alt="image-20230215010124607" style="zoom:67%;"></div> <p>We get this weird landscape.

We only have a <strong>sampled</strong> version of the image function, so we need to approximate the partial derivatives.</p> <p>Let’s just consider one of them.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XNH2diH.png" alt="image-20230215011836329" style="zoom:67%;"></div> <p><strong>First row</strong></p> <p>When we do the approximation, because $\Delta x \to 0$ in discrete function meaning the smallest step =&gt; The next pixel along the row. =&gt; I could just move one pixel to the right =&gt; I take a step of 1. =&gt; Therefore, the approximation.</p> <p>Even though this is not the limit where we have, but we’ve just made it as small as possible with the data we have. <strong>So this is one way to approximate a partial derivative on a discrete function.</strong></p> <p>This approximation is also known as a forward approximation that is because we’re moving 1 step to the right.</p> <p>We can also have a backward approximation =&gt; Midpoint approximation.</p> <p><strong>Second row</strong></p> <p>We move a row down in the image. We need to look one pixel ahead of the target pixel. =&gt; Down</p> <p><strong>Higher dimensionality</strong></p> <p>Skip</p> <p><strong><em>We can construct linear filter kernels from these approximations (forward differencing).</em></strong></p> <p>We just need to subtract neighbor pixels from each other.</p> <p>Since correlation does not require us to flip the filter, let’s start in the case where we want to construct the filter that we can use with correlation.</p> <p>Let’s go with the derivatives with $x$ firstly. It involves a target pixel value $f(x, y)$, and the one that just to the right of that pixel. The operation actually does here is picking out the value $f(x+1, y)$ and picking out the value $f(x, y)$ and changing the sign to $-$. So the filter kernel could look like $[-1, 1]$. We are computing the derivative at $(x, y)$ and we’re going to assume that in this filter mask, the $-1$ is the center of the filter. This pixel should be a line with the target pixel $(x, y)$.</p> <p>Whatever we have at $(x, y)$, we multiply that by $-1$ and then, we take one step to the right. And we take out the value we have at $(x+1, y)$ and just multiply that by 1. At the end, correlation is a sum, so now you have</p> \[f(x+1, y) - f(x, y)\] <p>So, this implements derivative using the $[-1 \ 1]$ impulse response, and doing correlation. The difference between correlation and convolution is that flipping the filter.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WwqPPrL.png" alt="image-20230215015059514" style="zoom:67%;"></div> <h4 id="other-first-order-derivative-filters">Other first order derivative filters</h4> <p>We have something called <strong>Roberts</strong> field that it take the derivatives along the diagonal in this 2 by 2 mask.
